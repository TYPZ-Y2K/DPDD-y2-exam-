📑 Task 3b – What to Do Guide
🎯 Goal

Write an evaluation report showing how well your prototype meets requirements and what improvements are needed, using the feedback gathered in Task 3a.

Step 1 – Evaluate Assets & Content

What to do:

Review the assets you used (images, videos, sample data, code snippets).

Ask: Were they appropriate for the prototype?

Check validity & reliability of sources (was the info accurate, up-to-date?).

Note any legal/ethical issues:

Copyright (did you use unlicensed material?).

GDPR/privacy (personal data).

Representation (inclusive images, no stereotypes).

Nuance:

“Validity” = was the source accurate and suitable?

“Reliability” = can it be trusted (e.g. official site vs random blog)?

Distinction → Show awareness of bias, copyright, inclusivity.

Step 2 – Evaluate Prototype Against Requirements

What to do:

Compare your solution to:

Functional requirements (login, quizzes, tracking, etc.).

Non-functional requirements (performance, usability, accessibility).

KPIs (e.g. <2s load time, uptime %, engagement).

User acceptance criteria (UAC) (e.g. “users can register without errors”).

Say which requirements were fully met, partially met, or not met.

Nuance:

Examiners want specific evidence (not just “it worked well”).

Distinction → Use feedback from 3a to support claims.

Example: “80% of users said navigation was easy (UAC met).”

Step 3 – Improvements & Future Development

What to do:

Suggest improvements supported by feedback.

Example: “Add dark mode” if users reported readability issues.

Suggest future features (AI, gamification expansion, VR).

Justify why improvements matter (link back to requirements or KPIs).

Nuance:

“Future development” ≠ random wish list. It must link to:

User feedback.

Business goals.

Unmet requirements.

Step 4 – Structure Your Evaluation

What to do:
Write your report in 3 clear sections:

Assets & Content – Appropriateness, validity, legality, ethics.

Evaluation vs Requirements – FR, NFR, KPIs, UAC.

Improvements – Feedback-driven, realistic, linked to client needs.

Nuance:

Distinction → Show balance (what worked well + what needs work).

Always connect feedback → requirement → improvement.

✅ Distinction-Level Tips

Use specific feedback quotes/data from Task 3a.

Reference requirements and KPIs directly.

Show legal/ethical awareness (copyright, GDPR, accessibility).

Propose realistic, evidence-based improvements.
