üìë Task 3a ‚Äì What to Do Guide
üéØ Goal

Gather feedback on your prototype from technical and non-technical audiences, then record it clearly so you can use it in Task 3b.

Step 1 ‚Äì Prepare Feedback Materials

What to do:

Make tools to collect feedback. Examples:

Questionnaires (with both open + closed questions).

Observation sheets (to record user interactions, ‚Äúpain points‚Äù).

Demonstrations/screencasts (showing features).

Interview prompts (structured questions).

Nuance:

Closed questions = Yes/No, ratings (quantitative).

Open questions = opinions, suggestions (qualitative).

Distinction ‚Üí Use both types so you capture measurable + detailed feedback.

Step 2 ‚Äì Plan the Feedback Process

What to do:

State who you‚Äôll get feedback from:

Technical audience (programmers, developers).

Non-technical audience (client, learners, parents).

State how you‚Äôll do it: questionnaires, interviews, observations.

State what aspects you want feedback on:

Functionality.

Usability.

Accessibility.

Performance.

Nuance:

Examiners want to see you thought about different audiences.

Distinction ‚Üí Your plan should be systematic (cover multiple aspects, not random).

Step 3 ‚Äì Collect the Feedback

What to do:

Use your tools (questionnaires, demos).

Make sure you gather data from both technical + non-technical audiences.

Encourage detailed answers (especially in open questions).

Nuance:

‚ÄúFeedback‚Äù is evidence, so keep the responses clear and traceable.

Distinction ‚Üí Feedback should be complete (cover UI, functionality, performance, accessibility).

Step 4 ‚Äì Record Feedback Clearly

What to do:

Present results in a clear, professional format:

Tables (e.g. User ‚Üí Rating ‚Üí Comments).

Graphs (e.g. % of users who rated UI > 7/10).

Written summaries of key points.

Nuance:

Examiners want usable feedback (not just ‚Äúit was good‚Äù).

Distinction ‚Üí Show both quantitative data (numbers, charts) and qualitative insights (comments).

‚úÖ Distinction-Level Tips

Use different tools (questionnaire + demo + observation).

Cover both audiences (technical + non-technical).

Ensure feedback is measurable (ratings/graphs) and meaningful (opinions/suggestions).

Communicate findings clearly for both audiences (no jargon for non-technical).
